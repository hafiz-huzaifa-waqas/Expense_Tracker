Hello! This is Hafiz Huzaifa Bin Waqas. And I am presenting my python project: 🧾 EXPENSE TRACKER

It is a ***simple personal expense tracker***, where the user can log daily income and expenses, view summaries by category, and check full transaction history. It helps beginners practice Python through a real-life use case.

📁 Project Structure -> A menu containing 4 options is displayed providing options to:
-> Add a transaction (enter the amount (positive for deposit and negative for withdarwal, category (where the amount expended), description (for maintaining proper record))
-> View Summary (to view transaction by category and total deposited or withdrew amount and remaining balance)
-> View transaction history (To view complete record of each transaction)
-> Quit (To exit the program)

It covers following main core Python topics: ● Variables & Data Types ● Input / Output ● Conditions & Loops ● Functions ● Lists & Dictionaries ● File Handling ● Exception Handling
